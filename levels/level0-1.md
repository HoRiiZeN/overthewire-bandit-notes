# Level 0 â†’ Level 1:  
**Goal:**  
 find the password for the next level that is stored in a readme file in the home directory.
 
**Solution:**  
I used `pwd` to see where I am, after making sure that I'm in the `/home/bandit0` dir, I used `ls` to list the files and then `cat readme` to print its content.
